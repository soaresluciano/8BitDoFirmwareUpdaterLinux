# 8BitDo Firmware Updater Linux

This automated script sets up the official 8BitDo Firmware Updater Tool to operate on Linux systems through Wine. It allows Linux users to easily upgrade their 8BitDo controller firmware without the need for Windows.

I made this script to document and automate my steps, hoping others find it useful too.

**Based on the excellent work shared at:** https://gist.github.com/archeYR/d687de5e484ce7b45d6a94415a04f3dc

## üéÆ What This Does

1. ‚úÖ Check for required dependencies
2. üîß Install udev rules for device access
3. üç∑ Create and configure a Wine prefix
4. üì¶ Download the official 8BitDo Firmware Updater
5. üé® Install required fonts (Segoe UI)
6. üñ•Ô∏è Create a desktop application entry

## üîß Prerequisites

Before running the setup script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Wine** (for running windows apps)
- **wget** (for downloading files)
- **unzip** (for extracting archives)
- **sudo access** (for installing udev rules)

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/soaresluciano/8BitDoFirmwareUpdaterLinux.git
   cd 8BitDoFirmwareUpdaterLinux
   ```

2. **Identify your device (important!):**
   ```sh
   lsusb
   ```
   or the detailed version
   ```sh
   lsusb -v
   ```
   Look for a line containing "8BitDo" or your device's model. It will show something like:
    ```
    Bus 001 Device 005: ID 2dc8:5750 8BitDo SN30 Pro
    ```

    In this example:
    - Vendor ID (idVendor): `2dc8`
    - Product ID (idProduct): `5750`

3. **Update device configuration:**
   Edit `assets/71-8bitdo-boot.rules` with your device's Vendor ID and Product ID

4. **Script configuration (optional):**
   Review and customize the default paths used by the script if needed.
   You can find these variables at the top of the `setup.sh` file.
   _See [Script Configuration](#Ô∏è-script-configuration) section for details._

5. **Run the setup script:**
   Execute the script using:
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   - During execution, you may be prompted to install Mono. Accept the installation when prompted.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Script Configuration

The setup script uses configurable paths that you can customize at the top of `setup.sh`. Most users can run the script with default settings, but you may need to adjust these if your system uses non-standard locations:

 - `WINE_PREFIX_DIR`: Base directory for Wine prefixes (default: `$HOME`).
 - `WINE_PREFIX_NAME`: Name (and directory) of the Wine prefix (default: `.wine-8bitdo`).
 - `TOOL_DIR`: Installation directory for the Windows 8BitDo application files (default: `$HOME/.local/share/8bitdo-updater`).
 - `UDEV_RULES_DIR`: System directory for udev rules (default: `/etc/udev/rules.d`).
 - `APPS_DIR`: Directory for desktop application entries (default: `$HOME/.local/share/applications`).

## üí° Usage

### Launching the Application

After successful installation, you can launch the firmware updater via the "8BitDo Firmware Updater" in your application menu.

**Known Issue**
- A dialog with a lengthy error message (Fatal Error code: 0x80041002 str: ...) may appear behind the main application window. **Do not close this dialog** - simply leave it running in the background, as closing it shuts the main app.

### Updating Controller Firmware

1. Put your controller into **update mode** (refer to your controller's manual)
2. Connect the controller via USB
3. Launch the 8BitDo Firmware Updater
4. Follow the on-screen instructions in the updater

### Debug Information

If you need to troubleshoot:

1. **Check Wine configuration:**
   ```sh
   WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-8bitdo" winecfg
   ```

2. **View Wine logs:**
   ```sh
   WINEPREFIX="$HOME/.wine-8bitdo" WINEDEBUG=+all wine "$HOME/.local/share/8bitdo-updater/8BitDo Firmware Updater.exe" 2>&1 | less
   ```

3. **Check udev rules:**
   ```sh
   sudo udevadm info --attribute-walk --name=/dev/hidraw0
   ```

4. **Check the usb connectivity of you device:**
   ```sh
   sudo dmesg | tail -20
   ```

For development, you can run the script in debug mode:
```sh
./setup.sh debug
```
This creates a local test environment in the `DEBUG/` directory without modifying system files.
